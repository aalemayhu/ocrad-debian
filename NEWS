Changes in version 0.25:

The new option "-E, --user-filter", which allows the use of user-defined
filters, has been added.

Character recognition has been improved. ('2' vs 'Z', '4' vs 'Q',
'5' vs 'S', 'E', 'J', merged 'VV').

Uppercase 'Y' with acute and 'Y' with diaeresis are now recognized.

Uppercase 'S' and 'Z' with caron are no more misrecognized as lowercase.

The new built-in filters "text_block" and "upper_num_mark" have been
added.

The output of "--help" has been extended.

The new chapters "Introduction" and "Filters" have been added to the
manual.

The testsuite now checks the recognition of 11 more characters.

The targets "install-compress", "install-strip-compress",
"install-info-compress" and "install-man-compress" have been added to
the Makefile. (Installing compressed docs may become the default in the
future).
