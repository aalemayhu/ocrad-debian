Changes in version 0.25:

Character recognition has been improved. ('2' vs 'Z', '4' vs 'Q',
'5' vs 'S', 'E', 'J', merged 'VV').

The new filters "text_block" and "upper_num_mark" have been added.

The output of "--help" has been extended.

The targets "install-compress", "install-strip-compress",
"install-info-compress" and "install-man-compress" have been added to
the Makefile. (Installing compressed docs may become the default in the
future).
